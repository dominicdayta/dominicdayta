### Thanks for stopping by!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dominic, professor of Statistics at the School of Statistics, University of the Philippines, Diliman.

- I do consulting work for private firms and research groups, helping build strong, bespoke models and analytics strategies towards organizational/academic goals.
- I also hold trainings and short courses on the following subjects: Statistical Quality Control, Data Visualization, Introductory Statistical Learning, and Statistical Programming with R.
- For the most part, code found here are from my research work, but I'm also currently involved in not a few web development projects that I'm looking forward to sharing with the rest of the Dev community.
